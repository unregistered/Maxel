  <p class="lead">Here's where I can answer common questions. If you have a question that's not on this list, you can tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/maxelapp">@maxelapp</a> or email <a href="mailto:support@maxelapp.com">support@maxelapp.com</a>.

  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <div class="question">How do I add a download?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>There are many ways to initiate new downloads. The easiest is to highlight text containing links in your browser (like Safari) and then drag this text into Maxel's dock icon or window.</p>
    <p>You could also press Command + N (⌘N) in Maxel to open the Add Sheet. <a href="/add-sheet.html">Click</a> for more details on the Add Sheet.</p>
    <p>And finally, you can also try the experimental <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-to-maxel/chgjmjbmaokmnccgmbfhlhhmnckhndcb">Chrome To Maxel</a> if you're using Google Chrome.</p>

  <div class="question">I'm not seeing my download speed improve?</div>
  <div class="answer">Maxel will only increase your speeds up to the bandwidth of your computer's connection. So if you have a 3 Mbps cable connection, that's the fastest you'll go. But in this case, Maxel will help if the server you're downloading from will only give you 300 kbps&mdash;just crank up the threads to 10, and you should get about 3 Mbps.</div>
  <div class="question">Maxel gets slow when I use 100+ connections?</div>
  <div class="answer">At this point you're not gaining speed due to the overhead of establishing each connection. Try reducing the number of connections to 10 and work your way up from there.</div>
  <div class="question">Why does my SFTP download fail with > 10 connections?</div>
  <div class="answer">The error message is: "Failure establishing SSH session. You may have too many connections..." The SSH server probably defaults to a maximum of 10 connections. To increase it, modify sshd_config (usually /etc/sshd/sshd_config) and delete the line if it exists:<br>
  <pre>MaxStartups 10:30:60</pre><br>
  Add the line<br>
  <pre>MaxStartups 100:30:160</pre><br>
  This will allow you to establish up to 100 connections simultaneously.
